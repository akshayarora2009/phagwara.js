# phagwara.js
Just-for-fun, interpreted and basic programming language written on top of JavaScript, based on a popular "dialect" spoken exclusively by Computer Science class of '17, PEC University.

### Getting Started
The syntax is offered in two flavors - `officialJeha` and `Saukha Kinna`, the former is the one that is actually parsed and interpreted, while the latter is a syntactic sugar - allowing different lines of code to be simply written, just seperated by a newline.

### Examples
#### Program to calculate sum of numbers from 1 to 10

#### Saukha kinna

`korKor(dindaa(total,0)
dindaa(count,1)
jadoTak(<(count,11)
korKor(dindaa(total,+(total,count))
dindaa(count, +(count,1))))
dasdaa(total))`
